# cs3231-notes
This is my summary of the materials from CS3231 Theory of Computation in the format of definitions and theorems. I brought these materials as printed notes into the two midterms as well as the final exam of the course.

Materials are subject to inaccuracies. If you spot any, do open an issue.
